  Since people began their ingenuity, we have devised increasingly intelligent robots to help us cope with dangerous and burdensome work. We continuously confer various human capabilities on machines, and now try to think what will happen if robotics become even more advanced.

  As far as I'm concerned, in the near future, the modern world will be populated by intelligent devices which can replace much human labor. Our work in factory will down by robot assembly arms. Our cooking, washing and other housework will be completed by robot servers. Our public security will be managed by tireless robot police. In addition, due to the micro-mechanics, there will be more robot systems which can perform highly difficult surgery with sub-millimeter accuracy to help patients alleviate their pain and suffering.

  But, as I think, if robots are to reach the next stage, there will still be many challenges. We all know that human brain is far more complicated, and the most intelligent robot system will never catch up with human mind's ability. So I have to say, there is still a long way for robot technology to go.

  Suppose individuals intend to acquire true knowledge, it is advisable for them to practice more. Thus, when hearing the remark "Knowledge is a treasure, but practice is the key to it.", we can easily perceive its connotation. Apparently, this saying can be naturally associated with the close relationship between knowledge and practice.

  Whether in history or today, it is a common belief for people to consider knowledge as a treasure. Meanwhile, an increasing number of scholars or wise men find it more significant to practice knowledge, if they want to master it better. Two typical examples can be given: English language is a treasure which helps us to communicate with the world, but without practice, it would be impossible to speak it fluently; science and technology is a treasure which pushes forward social development, but with no practice, it would be hard for scientists to innovate. It is practice that can enable humans to combine valuable knowledge with reality. As a matter of fact, intelligent people in large numbers have come to realize the significance of practice for knowledge.

  I, as a college student, am convinced that it is of great necessity for teenagers to gain knowledge and it is of greater necessity to practice it more. Do bear in mind: practice makes perfect.

  It is universally acknowledged that the relationship between employers and employees plays a crucial role in our society. A well-known saying goes that trust is the glue of life and the foundational principle that holds all relationships, which proves building trust between employers and employees is imperative.

  Firstly, with credit between the two parties, employees' initiative at work would be actively encouraged. Consequently, employees' efficiency will be enhanced. Secondly, trust would contribute to the acceleration of the company's development. Mutual trust and respect facilitate communication and collaboration, which results in success in the fierce competition in business. For instance, Hidilao Hot Pot, one of the greatest companies in the catering industry, attaches great importance to mutual trust. If its employers and employees don't believe in each other, they cannot have mushroomed rapidly in recent years. Thirdly, due to mutual trust society can gain impetus to flourish to a large extent. And it boosts the development of individuals in return.

  In a nutshell, it can never be denied that fostering credibility between the two is extraordinarily significant. Only by promoting reliability can our society be more prosperous and harmonious.

  Upon graduation, virtually all college students will confront the problem of choosing their careers. It is truly a tough choice. Students' opinions differ greatly on this issue. Some hold that priority should be given to their interest in the job, but others take the attitude that salary is the most critical factor influencing their career choices.

  As for myself, I prefer the latter view. A well-paid job exerts a tremendous fascination on a great number of people, with no exception to me. Although it might be impossible to measure the value of one's job in terms of money, salary counts most when I choose my future career. In my view, our career choices largely depend on how and where we have been brought up. I come from a poor urban family and my parents are both laid-off workers. In order to finance my tuition, they have been working hard over the past four years. As the only son in my family, I have to shoulder the burden of supporting my family.

  In short, salary is the first consideration in my choice of career.

The Importance of Having a Sense of Community Responsibility



 Any community is composed of individuals. Naturally, it matters a great deal to our communities that we have a sense of responsibility towards them.

  People living in the same area should be considered a group under an obligation to create a comfortable living environment for the whole community. Reaching this goal requires a sense of responsibility among all residents, which encourages them to start with small steps, such ad avoiding making excessive noise that disturbs their neighbors. Moreover, a sense of collective responsibility among us students contributes to a warm and friendly atmosphere, where we respect and help each other, as well as a strong communal sense of belonging. It will ultimately be conducive to ourselves in a new community made up of colleagues. A sense of community responsibility, also known as team spirit in the workplace, will be the key to forming a united and cohesive group, where we strive towards a common objective in close cooperation with each other.

  In conclusion, a sense of community responsibility is worth fostering in that it plays significant role in living, learning and working.

  Recently the phenomenon of certificate craze has become a big concern of the public. It is also a new craze in the university, which seems like a routine activity on campus, for certificates do play a vital role when students look for a decent job.

  Admittedly, there are different purposes behind this phenomenon. Some people aim at certificates because of the employment pressure. With the admission expansion of colleges, a great many graduates have to face the fierce competition in the job market. So it is the certificates that can make them more competitive. However, some others consider all the diploma and certificates important standards by which a person's ability can be measured. They spare no effort to get the certificates for the sole purpose of proving that they are qualified in a certain field. Moreover, there are those who just want to enrich their life by preparing for the certificates because they really enjoy their progress.

  From my point of view , we should be more rational when it comes to certificates. Since certificates do not necessarily prove one's ability. Being crazy in getting certifications blindly is nothing but wasting time. To conclude, we should focus on improving our ability but not merely getting a certificate.

  My View on Social Skills



  As the saying goes, "The pleasure of association is the base of life." The quotation from one of the greatest French scientists, Andre Maurois, teaches us the importance of social skills, which are regarded as the most vital among all the important skills of human beings, especially in the workplace. Statistics show that one's career success depends heavily on his or her social skills. Those who possess excellent social skills are more likely to promote an easy-going relationship with their partners, which naturally result in a successful career.

  Given that social skills play such an essential role in our work, what should we do to cultivate this spirit? On the one hand, the key to good social skills is definitely the ability to listen to our interlocutor, which lays the foundation for cooperation with others. On the other hand, to reach a high level of interpersonal relationship, it is advisable for us to put ourselves in others' shoes and understand them, which can help us clear up the misapprehensions that hinder our work.

  All in all, one's performance at the workplace is closely related to efficient social skills. If we are to succeed in career, we must improve our social skills.
